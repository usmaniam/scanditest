This <strong>E-commerce CRUD App</strong> is a PHP project I built  to meet specific technical requirements, focusing on object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.

<strong>Technical Requirements</strong>:

1. <strong>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles</strong>: The project utilizes OOP principles to handle differences in type logic/behavior, with meaningful classes that extend each other. An abstract class for the main product logic demonstrates polymorphism provision.

2. <strong>Procedural PHP Code</strong>: Procedural PHP code is used exclusively to initialize PHP classes. The rest of the logic is placed within class methods.

3. <strong>MySQL Logic with Objects</strong>: MySQL logic is handled by objects with properties instead of direct column values. Setters and getters are utilized for both saving and displaying logic.

4. <strong>PSR Standards</strong>: The project adheres to PSR standards for PHP coding.

5. <strong>Avoidance of Conditional Statements</strong>: Conditional statements, such as if-else and switch-case, are avoided for handling differences in product types. Instead, a single general endpoint is used for product saving.

6. <strong>No framework</strong>: Plain classes and no frameworks, following an OOP approach.
